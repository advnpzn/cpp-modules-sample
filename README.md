## Hii!
This is a sample repository to demonstrate the use of C++ 20 modules feature in your C++ code with CMake build system.
This just contains some pretty barebones code so that things could be understood quickly.

### What you'll need.
1. A C++ compiler that supports C++ 20 out of the box. And even if they support, some compilers would required some special flags to be enabled to even support modules usage.
2. A recent version of CMake which supports the use of CXX_MODULES. i.e. I believe any version of CMake >= 3.28 supports this.
